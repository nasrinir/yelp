# Yelp

Yelp was founded to help people find great local businesses like restaurants in 2004. Yelp allows users to give star ratings, encouraged to write reviews, and take photos of their experiences. The information, the reviews and photos, can be extracted and beneficial to business owners as well as customers. 

Restaurants with high ratings on Yelp and they can be overrated by others. The reason is that people have different tastes and standards for restaurants. Comparing star ratings, the reviews, and images are more indicative of restaurantsâ€™ properties and user preferences.
